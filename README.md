## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Project Is Postponed

WhisprMail was built to revolutionize how you manage your Gmail inbox by combining powerful AI features with seamless email management. The app offers intelligent summarization, emotion detection to gauge urgency, and quick actions like starring or deleting emails as soon as they arrive.  

However, because WhisprMail accesses **restricted Gmail API scopes** to read and modify user emails, Google requires the project to undergo a **Cloud Application Security Assessment (CASA)**. This is a thorough third-party security audit designed to protect user data and ensure compliance with strict privacy and security standards.  

Unfortunately, this CASA process involves significant time and financial investment‚Äîoften running into tens of thousands of dollars and taking several weeks to complete. Due to these constraints, the full Gmail integration and public release of WhisprMail have been paused for now.  

Despite the postponement, the app‚Äôs core AI-powered features, user interface, and workflow have been fully developed and are included in this repository as a demo. This allows the project to serve as a portfolio piece and learning resource, while protecting user security and complying with Google‚Äôs policies.

## üì∏ Feature Spotlight: AI-Powered Email Summarization & Emotion Detection

At the heart of WhisprMail is an intelligent AI system powered by Huggingface models, designed to transform how you process incoming emails:

- **Automatic Summarization:** Long, complex emails are distilled into concise summaries so you can quickly grasp the main points without sifting through every word.  
- **Emotion & Urgency Detection:** The app analyzes the emotional tone of emails‚Äîdetecting urgency, frustration, or importance‚Äîto help prioritize your responses effectively.  
- **Instant Email Actions:** Streamline your inbox by automatically marking emails unread, starring important ones, or deleting unwanted messages immediately after they arrive.  

All of this is delivered within a **responsive, clean user interface** built with modern CSS, ensuring a smooth experience across devices and screen sizes.
